do you know function pointers ?

ok, you can see std::function as its advanced version.

A function pointer is a type of pointer that points to a function in memory. It can be used to call the function indirectly through the pointer. Function pointers are useful in cases where you need to pass a function as an argument to another function, or when you want to store a function in a data structure so that it can be called later.

std::function is a class template in the C++ Standard Library that represents a function or function object. It is a type-erasing wrapper that can hold a reference or pointer to any callable entity, such as a function, lambda expression, or function object. std::function is often used as a more flexible and type-safe alternative to function pointers.

While both function pointers and std::function allow you to store and invoke functions or function objects, std::function has several advantages over function pointers:

std::function can store and invoke any callable entity, not just functions. This makes it more flexible and allows you to store lambdas and function objects in a std::function object.

std::function is type-safe. It ensures that the function or function object stored in it has the correct signature. With function pointers, you have to manually ensure that the function you are calling has the correct signature, which can lead to runtime errors if you make a mistake.

std::function can be used with the C++ Standard Library algorithms and data structures that accept function objects as arguments, such as std::sort or std::for_each. Function pointers cannot be used directly with these algorithms and data structures.

In summary, while function pointers and std::function both allow you to store and invoke functions or function objects, std::function is more flexible, type-safe, and easier to use with the C++ Standard Library.
